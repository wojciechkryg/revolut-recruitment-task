# Revolut Recruitment Task ![](/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png)

## Task
List all currencies you get from the endpoint (one per row). Each row has an input where you can enter any amount of money. When you tap on a currency row it should slide to the top and it's input becomes the first responder. When youâ€™re changing the amount the app must simultaneously update the corresponding value for other currencies.

## Build variants
This solution consist of 4 build variants:
- mock
- develop
- test
- production

Except mock build every build variant should have different base api url. Currently there is only one used for rest of them. It can be easily changed in `Config.kt` file.

## Problem
I have decided to use different api call when it is different currency on the top of the list. I came across problem that api does not return very small values for currency rates.

For example api call `https://hiring.revolut.codes/api/android/latest?base=IDR` returns a lot of zero values.
